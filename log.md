# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went from class 08 to 12, on the [React For Beginners](ReactForBeginners.com) course. I learned how to handle form submit event.

**Thoughts:** I gotta pay more attention on the props side of the course!

### Day 1: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've done the [React For Beginners](ReactForBeginners.com) course, lecture 13. I learned how states work.

**Thoughts:** I felt that i'm gonna need a more deep study on state, i'm still a little confused.
